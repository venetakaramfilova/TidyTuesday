In the United States, the federal government's fiscal year starts on October 1st and ends on September 30th of the following year. For example, Fiscal Year 2024 (FY 2024) would start on October 1, 2023, and end on September 30, 2024.

```{r}
cbp_state <- 
  cbp_state |>
  mutate(
    month = match(tolower(month_abbv), tolower(month.abb)),
    demographic = case_when(
      demographic == "UC / Single Minors" ~ "Single Minors", 
      demographic == "FMUA" ~ "Individual in a Family Unit",
      TRUE ~ demographic
    ), 
    calendar_year = if_else(month >= 10, fiscal_year - 1, fiscal_year), 
    year_month = make_date(calendar_year, month, 1)
  ) |>
  filter(calendar_year > 2019) # only 3 months for 2019

For example, a family unit consisting of two or more individuals is encountered. The data would show two or more individuals, not one family unit. Beginning in March 2020, 'Individual in a Family Unit' data also includes Title 42 Expulsions of a family 
group of at least one child and one related adult (regardless of whether the adult and child met the definition of a family unit).\n\n\nSource: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encounter data, via Tony Galván | Plot: Veneta Karamfilova",
